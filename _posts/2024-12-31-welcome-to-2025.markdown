# Let’s Go 2025! New Year’s Resolutions in Action 🚀

I’m excited to announce that I’m starting the development of my **own game engine in C++**! 🎮  
For now, it will focus on **2D** and will be tailored to create a game that’s been on my mind for a while.  

## Project Goals 🎯
1. **Learn C++**: This project is primarily a learning journey to deepen my understanding of C++.
2. **Build a Game Engine**: Create a functional and customizable 2D game engine from scratch.
3. **Develop a Game**: Use the engine to bring my game idea to life.

## Progress Updates 📅
I’ll be sharing regular updates on the development process, including:
- Milestones achieved 🏁
- Challenges faced and solutions 💡
- Code snippets and explanations 📝

## Documentation & Public Release 📖
The **documentation** for the game engine will be hosted on this site, providing detailed guides, API references, and tutorials.  
Once I feel the engine has reached a **sufficient level of maturity**, I’ll make it **publicly available** for others to use and contribute to. Stay tuned for updates on its release! 🌐
